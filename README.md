# HDocBook documentation
This is an example of a simple static content documentation project that is compatible with the Hornbill Docs system

Once you have installed hdoc-tools, to preview the documentation in a browser, you can open a terminal window and run the server with the command `hdoc serve`, and in a local browser navigate to the following URL: `http://localhost:3000`.
