# Advanced Editing Workflow
This guide explains how to set up and configure the Advanced Editing workflow for Hornbill documentation. 

The main benefit of the advanced editing workflow over the Basic Editing workflow is being able to preview documents in a browser window as you work on them.

The Advanced Edits workflow is more complex to setup and configure than the [Simple Edits workflow](/_books/hdoc-guide/getting-started/simple-edits) as you need to install a number of dependencies and tools. You will also need to register a free account with a third-party, GitHub.

Once you are set up, the [Document editing and publishing workflow](/_books/hdoc-guide/getting-started/complex-edits) is relatively straightforward.

## Overview
The advanced editing workflow uses around Hornbill's hdoc-tools is a command line extension of Node.js that allows you to preview Hornbill documentation in a browser window.

With this workflow, you edit and preview Hornbill's GitHub documentation content offline using a text editor and Git then you submit it back to GitHub for publishing. Using this workflow, you will:

1. Check out (fork) content from Hornbill's main branch of the documentation. The forked content is hosted online into your GitHub account.
2. Copy (clone) documents from your account to your local machine then edit it using a text editor.
3. Save (commit) documents locally using Git.
4. Send documents back (push) to your online GitHub account.
5. Publish (commit) your changes to Hornbill's main branch to be validated by Hornbill then included in the public-facing Hornbill documentation. 

This guide recommends using Microsoft's Visual Studio as a text editor, but you can use an alternative of your choice. Visual studio is free, well-supported, and has a large ecosystem of extensions that can be useful when editing documentation.

## Before you begin
The following steps must be complete before you can edit and commit Hornbill documentation:
1. Register for a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you do not already have one.
2. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). 
3. Follow these instructions to [Link your installation of Git to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).
4. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
5. Download and install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Minimum version: Node.js LTS v18 LTS).

  ::: important
  Install the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js. Non-LTS versions are not validated by Hornbill.
  ::: 
  ::: note
  During the Node.js installation, you may be asked to automatically install the tools necessary to compile native modules. Because these tools are required by the Hornbill's HDocBook tooling, you must either:
   1. Allow the Node.js installation to download and install these automatically.
   2. Install the tooling manually once the Node.js installation is complete. To do this, see the [node-gyp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp)  package documentation for further information.
   :::
6.  Install HDocBook Tools. To install HDocBook Tools, open a terminal window and enter the following command: 
    ```bash
    npm install hdoc-tools -g
    ```
   Depending on your local operating system persmissions, you may need to run the command as the root user. This installs the package globally to your Node.js installation, making the `hdoc` CLI tool available for you to use. 

## Document editing and publishing workflow
Follow these steps to edit and publish documents:

1. Select a Document to edit. To do this, browse to the [Hornbill Docs GitHub account](https://github.com/Hornbill-Docs) and locate the document you wish to contribute to. 

2. Fork your copy on GitHub. To contribute to a HDocBook you are first required to fork the HDocBook repository that contains it, which will make a copy of that repository in your personal GitHub account. In your Github account, having selected the Hornbill document, select the Fork menu item and create a new Fork.

3. Clone your copy to your local computer. To do this:
    1. On your computer, create a folder called "hornbill-docs" in the desired location.
    2. Open a terminal window in that folder and type the command:

   `git clone [your cloned HDocBook url]`

4. Preview the document. To do this:
    1. In Visual Studio, select File -> Open Folder and open the first/top-level hdoc-guide folder. This folder contains the hdocbook-project.json file. 
    2. Select Terminal > New Terminal, to open a terminal window. 
    3. In the terminal prompt, type `hdoc serve` then press return to start the preview server. 
    4. Open a web browser then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/. The web browser should display a preview of the document.

5. Edit documents in Visual Studio and save changes as you go. You can work on multiple documents simultaneously in Visual Studio by having them open in different tabs. 

    ::: note
    Updates in the text editor are not automatically displayed in the document preview. To preview saved changes as you work on a document, refresh the browser page.
    :::

    ::: tip
    Run this command to view basic statistics of the document, including file count and total word count:
    - `hdoc stats`

    Run this command to access a more detailed breakdown of the statistics:
    - `hdoc stats -v`
    :::

6. __Verify the book integrity__
    Before committing your changes, stop your local server and run __hdoc verify__ which should catch any errors we will otherwise fail during the build process.  This command verifies the hdocbook integrity, making sure config files are correct, paths are set, links work, spelling and grammar complied with our writing standards and so on. 

7. __Commit your edits. To do this:__
    1. Select "Source Control" on the left side of the VS Code screen, then select "Commit". 
    2. A commit message window opens. Add a commit message then select the tick button to commit.

    ::: note
    A commit message is your description of the changes you have made. The message is read by Hornbill to evaluate your changes. The heading of your message (a summary of your actions) should be no more than 50 characters, and the body (details) should be no more than 72 characters. [See here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) for more information on practices for commit messages. 
    :::

8. __Push Your Changes to your Fork__
    To do this, select the "Sync Changes" button under the "Source Control" menu in Visual Studio.

9. __Create a Pull Request from Your Fork to the Hornbill Main Branch. To to this:__
    1. Go online to your GitHub account. 
    2. Navigate to your fork of the HDocBook repository. 
    3. Select "Pull Requests", then select "New Pull Request". Your pushed changes should appear here. If you cannot see your changes, ensure that you are in the correct fork.
    4. When prompted, add a message to summarize the pull request. If you pushed multiple versions of the document during editing, this message summarizes all of them. Note your commit messages are also preserved and submitted with the pull request.
    5. Select the option to submit the request.

After a pull request, your change is submitted to the Hornbill Documentation team. They will review the proposed changes and decide whether to approve them for inclusion in the Hornbill documentation.

## Next steps

Refer back to the [Document editing and publishing workflow](/_books/hdoc-guide/getting-started/complex-edits) for future Hornbill document editing.

You can use a combination of this Advanced Edits workflow and the [Simple Edits workflow](/_books/hdoc-guide/getting-started/simple-edits) depending on your need for the previewing feature.
