# Creating a New Book
This document will guide you through the process of creating a new Book. 

## Background to Publishing on Hornbill Docs
In order to understand the process of creating a new Book, it's important to have a concept of what the Hornbill Documentation system is. Fundamentally, the Hornbill Docs platform is a documentation publishing system, specifically designed for publishing official Hornbill documentation to the [docs.hornbill.com](https://docs.hornbill.com) website. 

Hornbill's documentation system borrows the basic concepts of physical paper book publishing, something very familiar to most of us, and so should be easy to understand and relate to. We consider the Hornbill documentation site to be our "public library" of documents, and just like a physical library, our individual units of documentation are known as "Books". Each Book comprises one or more individual articles, with tables of contents that organize the article(s) into a structure, much like chapters and tables of contents do in a traditional paper book. 

Part of the HDocs system is a taxonomy, which you can think of as like the classifications and areas of a library (such as literature, physics, computer science and fiction), and is used to take a collection of Books and organize them into a logical, easily navigable document Library.   

The Hornbill Docs team plays the role of "publisher" making sure that: 
- Book titles are relevant and well organized.
- Content is not duplicated.
- The taxonomy makes sense.
- The compiled Library is searchable and easily accessible by the intended audience.

## Do We Really Need a New Book?
Before creating a new Book, we must decide if it is needed. Unlike a physical library with paper books, the Hornbill Docs system uses a digital medium making it very easy to add or update existing Books' content. In fact, most Books published on the Hornbill Documentation site are published as open source on GitHub so that anyone that wishes to contribute can follow the Simple or Complex Edits workflows in order to do that. 

The reason why this question needs to be asked up front is that the Hornbill Docs team is quite selective about what new Books it will accept for publication on the [Hornbill Documentation Web Site](https://docs.hornbill.com). This is because, just like a publisher of physical books, the Hornbill Docs team want to ensure the quality, relevance and consistency of each Book in the Library. Any new Books will need to deliver standalone value, not (substantially or in part) duplicate existing content and be generally additive to the body of knowledge in the Hornbill Library. The Book will need to fit into its taxonomy and should cover topic(s) that are not already covered by existing documentation. 

## A New Book Proposal
The starting point for any new Book on the Hornbill Docs platform is the **New Book Proposal**, a formal request to the Hornbill Docs team outlining the information about the Book that should be created. Once you log into the Hornbill documentation site, you will find an option under the "Contributing" menu to "Request" or "Propose" a new Book. Each option will present you with a series of questions to help the Hornbill Docs team evaluate your request. Typically, customers or other users request that a new Book be created to cover the topic(s) they feel are not already covered in other documents. A proposal, on the other hand, would come from a subject matter expert who will create the Book content. 

When proposing a new Book to be published, the following information is required:

- Book Title
  - The most important attribute of a Book, the title is what will appear in the master index, search results and other key areas of the documentation system. The Book title must be meaningful and relevant and fit within the overall Library index structure.
- Synopsys
  - Just as important as the title; one to five paragraphs setting out the purpose and topics for the Book to cover.
- Audience
  - Must define the target audience in accordance to the Hornbill Docs taxonomy specification.
- Table of Contents (optional)
  - Ideally this would be useful at proposal stage, but we understand that it's often not possible. 

Once the Book has boon proposed, the Hornbill Docs team will review the proposal and either accept it or give feedback on what needs to be changed in order to achieve acceptance.

## Writing a Book for Hornbill Docs
We recognize that not everyone is an aspiring author or technical writer, and it's often the case that those who are subject matter experts are not writers and do not enjoy the process of writing documentation. We can look at the writing process on a Book-by-Book basis to figure out the best way to go about writing any given Book. The Hornbill Docs team can take on writing the Book, working with internal Subject Matter Experts to extract and capture knowledge, or we can use external writers or independent subject matter experts, or any combination of those things. If you want to write a Book but do not have the writing chops, that's also okâ€”write what you can and the Hornbill Docs team can expand, develop and evolve that content. The main goal is always to capture valuable content and ensure that we create the very best-quality documentation to help our customers, partners and teams at Hornbill.

With any contributions, the Hornbill Docs team will always run content through a process which includes copy-editing, fact verification and copywriting to ensure information is high quality, unambiguous and appropriate for the intended audience.
