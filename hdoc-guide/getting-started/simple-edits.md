# Simple Edits Workflow

If you wish to make simple edits, like spelling/grammar corrections or adding/removing text, you can achieve this with only a web browser and without the need to install special tools or libraries. The only requirement is a personal or company GitHub account. 

## Prerequisites 
- A personal or work GitHub account
- A web browser, connected to the internet

## GitHub

GitHub is an online source code and community projects website, primarily used for open-source projects. Hornbill maintains a GitHub account which is used for our documentation. Most documents on our Hornbill Docs site are made available as a public repository on our GitHub account.

You will be unable to contribute to Hornbill's documentation unless you have a GitHub account. If you do not have a GitHub account you can create one for free here: [Join GitHub for Free](https://github.com/join).

Once you have created a GitHub account, you can open the Hornbill-Docs home page and see the Hornbill Docs GitHub account here: [Hornbill-Docs](https://github.com/Hornbill-Docs).

You can then follow the instructions below to make and submit edits for consideration. 

## Using GitHub Online Only

Minor edits are easy using GitHub and its basic editing and Markdown preview capabilities. To make an edit to an existing document follow the steps below. 

1. Log into your GitHub account.
2. Search for, or browse to the [Hornbill-Docs](https://github.com/Hornbill-Docs) page.
3. Click on the ***Repositories*** tab, find the document you wish to contribute to, and then click on it to view its home page.
4. At the top right of the page you should see an option to "Fork". Choose that and accept the defaults. It will create a copy of the HDocBook source code on your account, and GitHub will automatically navigate you to the home page of the newly forked repo. 
5. You can now browse the files in the repo and click on individual .md file(s) you wish to edit. You can also edit the hdocbook.json file to add to or reorganize the navigation tree on the left. 
6. Once you open the file you want to edit, you can choose the "Edit" option in GitHub, and edit the Markdown text as required. 
7. Each time you complete your edits on a file, you will be asked to commit the changes and provide a message that will be attached to the commit. This message will be seen by our reviewer when your changes are sent to us, and should be a brief description of what was done. [See here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) for more information about commit messages. Please note that at this point you are only committing changes to your fork, not to the master documentation. 
8. Once you have edited all of the files that you wish to, you can create a pull request. Select the "Pull Requests" tab, and in that view, press the "New Pull Request" button. 
9. Review the changes and make sure you are happy with them, then press the "Create Pull Request" button.
10. Confirm by pressing the "Create Pull Request" button.

::: important
You will notice that the Markdown content can be previewed in GitHub. While the content is rendered, GitHub only supports the basic CommonMark specification, so features such a this info panel will not appear correctly there. Hornbill Docs uses a different specification of Markdown which will render them correctly.

Thats itâ€”your pull requests have been submitted to the Hornbill Docs team who will review and accept/reject your changes in due course.
