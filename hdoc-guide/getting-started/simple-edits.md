# How to make simple edits

To make simple edits, like fixing typos or adding text, all you need is a web browser and a GitHub account with sufficient privileges to the repository that you wish to edit.

## Prerequisites 
- A personal or work GitHub account
- A web browser, connected to the internet

## GitHub

If you do not have a GitHub account, you can [create one for free](https://github.com/join).

Once you have created a GitHub account, you can open the [Hornbill-Docs home page](https://github.com/Hornbill-Docs) and see the Hornbill Docs GitHub account.

You can then follow the instructions below to make and submit edits for consideration. 

## Using GitHub online only

Minor edits are easy using GitHub and its basic editing and Markdown preview capabilities. To make an edit to an existing document, follow these steps: 

1. Log into your GitHub account.
2. Go to the [Hornbill-Docs](https://github.com/Hornbill-Docs) page.
3. Click on the ***Repositories*** tab, then find and click on the document you want to edit.
   •  TIP: If you’re already reading an article on Hornbill’s docs site and want to make an edit, just click the pencil icon in the top right corner. This takes you straight to the page on GitHub, whether you’re logged in to your GitHub account or not.
5. At the top right of the page, click **Fork**. Accept the defaults, then click **Create fork**. This creates a copy of the HDocBook source code on your account. GitHub automatically navigates you to the home page of the newly forked repo.
6. Browse the files in the repository and click on an .md file you want to edit. You can also edit the hdocbook.json file to add to or reorganize the navigation tree of the book. 
7. Click the pencil icon (**Edit this file**), and make your edits to the Markdown text. 
8. Each time you complete your edits on a file, you will be asked to commit the changes and provide a message that will be attached to the commit. This message will be seen by our reviewer when your changes are sent to us, and should be a brief description of what was done. [See here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/) for more information about commit messages. Remember: you are only committing changes to your fork, not to the main repository. 
9. Once you have finished your edits, create a pull request. Select the "Pull Requests" tab, and in that view, click the **New Pull Request**. 
10. Review the changes and make sure you are happy with them, then click **Create Pull Request**.
11. Confirm by clicking **Create Pull Request** once more.

::: important
You will notice that the Markdown content can be previewed in GitHub. While the content is rendered, GitHub only supports the basic CommonMark specification, so features such as this info panel will not appear correctly there. Hornbill Docs uses a different specification of Markdown which will render the features correctly.  
:::

That's it — your pull requests have been submitted to the Hornbill Docs team who will review and accept/reject your changes in due course.
